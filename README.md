# 👋 Hey, I'm Curtis

**AI-Native Engineer · WebGL & Real-Time Systems · Deterministic AI Workflows**

Most developers use AI as autocomplete.  
I use AI as a **structured, orchestrated development system** capable of shipping enterprise-grade software faster and with fewer bugs.

Over the last year, I built **MetaCurtis** — a WebGL “consciousness theater” engine — with:

- **15,000+ GPU-driven particles at 60 FPS** on integrated GPUs  
- Real-time morphing constellations & narrative stages  
- A deterministic single-writer rendering pipeline  
- Contracts, guardrails, and evidence layers around all AI-generated code  

All of it was created **solo**, using a methodology I designed for predictable, production-safe AI development.

## 🧠 What I'm Focused On

### **1. AI-Native Engineering (my specialty)**  
Turning AI from “code suggestion” into a **deterministic, multi-agent development pipeline.**

I build systems where:

- Humans control architecture, contracts, event order, invariants  
- AI handles implementation *inside those boundaries*  
- Race conditions and drift are prevented at the pattern level  
- Code remains stable even when 70–90% is generated by AI  

---

### **2. High-Performance WebGL and Real-Time Systems**

- Particle engines  
- GPU-based motion  
- Interactive rendering pipelines  
- R3F + GLSL optimization  
- Architectures that run smoothly even on integrated GPUs  

---

### **3. The Future of Engineering Workflows**

Shifting from **human-first coding**  
→ to **AI-first, human-directed architecture**  
→ to **deterministic engineering at scale.**

## 🔬 Featured Project: MetaCurtis (Live)

**MetaCurtis** is my flagship system — both a narrative engine and the technical proof of my AI-native methodology.

- 15k particle WebGL engine  
- Stage-based morphing and “consciousness theater”  
- Adaptive quality system  
- Deterministic single-writer renderer  
- Built entirely with AI as the development engine

## 🚀 How I Work With Engineering Teams

I run a focused **4-week AI-Native Pilot** with engineering teams who:

- Use Copilot / Cursor / Claude extensively  
- Build complex frontends, visual systems, or real-time UIs  
- Are experiencing instability, regressions, or slowdowns  
- Want to combine AI development *with reliability*  

### **In the pilot, we:**

- Pick one painful engineering problem  
- Instrument and map system behavior  
- Apply deterministic AI-native patterns (contracts, guardrails, testing)  
- Implement a real fix in your codebase  
- Leave your team with reusable processes  

💡 Teams typically see **5–10× faster shipping** on complex issues **with fewer regressions**.

## 📚 AI-Native Engineering Patterns

I am publishing the AI-native methodology behind MetaCurtis:

- **Pattern S — Single Writer**  
- **Pattern D — Deterministic Directives**  
- **Pattern C — Contracts & Evidence**  
- Eventguard layers  
- State constraints  
- AI orchestration  
- Quality shields & validation
